## Tutorial walkthrough

### Download/create a .csv file

**note:** this file should contain at least sites locations (WGS84) and a numerical value that can be used as classifier (e.g. [this file](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9E3DXffjxAxMzlyOUdJNjRRa2s) where we should use elevation to classify sites)

Download the [](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9E3DXffjxAxMzlyOUdJNjRRa2s) on your own computer

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot01.png)

Such a window should pop-up.

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot02.png)

Choose a suitable name and directory and save this file. 

### Go to [Google Fusion Table web page](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232) and upload the .csv file

Open [Google Fusion Table web page](https://support.google.com/fusiontables/answer/2571232).

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot03.png)

Click on *create a fusion table* > *From this computer* , search for you .csv file and click *next*

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot04.png)

Check that the table is correctly formatted and click *next*

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot05.png)

You can add a short description of what this table is, contains, ... That should be helpful even more if you plan to share this table with collaborators. Click on *finish*.

### define/check that location info are well defined

Check that your sites location is done according to the longitude and latitudes you gave.

Click *Edit* > *Change columns*

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot08.png)

Define *site_name* variable as a *Text*

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot09.png)

And *latitude* as a *Location*. Ensure that *longitue* is recognized as the complementary location (using *Two columns location* check-box)

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot10.png)

Then save the modification and come back to the map. Check that your sites are correctly located on this map.

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot11.png)

**note:** you can play with the way to display the sites via the filter option (e.g. display only locations having a elevation between 300m and 500m)

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot12.png)

### make the FT available on the web

Click on *Share* on the top right corner

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot13.png)

Click on *modifier..* and select *Public*.

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot14.png)

Copy the id of your fusion table in the address bar of your browser (only part after *docid=*). This is the id you will use to import the fusion table in GEE.

### try to import the FT in GEE workspace to be sure that it is working

Go to your [GEE workspace](https://explorer.earthengine.google.com/#workspace).

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot16.png)

Click on *add data* > *Fusion Table*

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot17.png)

Paste you Fusion table id and load the table.

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot18.png)

Choose a classification variable (e.g. elevation) and set up a classification that suits you.

![](../materials/figures/pract_fusion_table/Screenshot19.png)

You can then edit the classification to change names, color, ...

You are done !!!

**Note**: In case you didn't manage to make it or if you want to compare you results to mine you can use one of the following sections.

## Link to the final fusion table / workspace

Here is the [link to the final fusion table](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/data?docid=1eEaV0k3lg2bQsJc-Pm3oIXNR-I4dfrYfV41cnMHM)

## JSON version of the final workspace

Here is the Json version of the final workspace. You can copy this lines and import them in your workspace.
