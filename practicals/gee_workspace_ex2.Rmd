## Tutorial walkthrough

### Note

This is a good idea to think to save the state of your workspace time to time.

### Load the SRTM 30m digital elevation product

Click on *add data*  

![](../materials/figures/pract_workspace2/Screenshot02.png)

Search for *SRTM elevation*, click on the *SRTM 30m digital elevation Data* product

![](../materials/figures/pract_workspace2/Screenshot03.png)

Click on the *question mark* icon to get further information on the selected product.

### Produce the slope and aspect maps

Click on *add computation*

![](../materials/figures/pract_workspace2/Screenshot06.png)

Select *Slope and aspect*. Then select the elevation maps as reference. By default the visualization will be based on a combination both elevation and aspect (RGB).

### Display the slope map in a nice way

To make it simpler we will here just focus only on the slope band.  
Click on the *Slope and aspect product* on the left panel, select the Slope band, and setup the color scale to cover 100% of the slope range (0-90).

Here we are on a grey-scale. 
We can choose to define our own color-scale. You can for instance use the excellent website [http://colorbrewer2.org/](http://colorbrewer2.org/) to generate a html color-scale that suits you. 

![](../materials/figures/pract_workspace2/Screenshot11.png)

I choose here this color-scale:

```html
ffffcc,ffeda0,fed976,feb24c,fd8d3c,fc4e2a,e31a1c,bd0026,800026
```

You can easily set it clicking on *Palete* then on the *pen icon* and pasting your colors scale in hexadecimal format.

You should now have something like:

### Export an image of the slope map of alpine arc (as .jpg)

Click on the slope map feature in the left panel, then click on the *downloading arrow*. Select the area, projection system and resolution that suits you and click on *Download*.

A window will pop-up..

Click *ok* ... You are done !!!

**Note**: In case you didn't manage to make it or if you want to compare you results to mine you can use one of the following sections.
